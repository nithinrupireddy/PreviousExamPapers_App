# PreviousExamPapers_App
My project is about collecting previous exam model papers for students to enhance their knowledge and awareness
of exam format. Also, our college faculty provides many assignment's and study material's for students to practice
and improve their skills. Many students use those resources to understand the concepts but, during exams they can't
spend more time on all those resources to prepare for exam so, students need some previous exam models to under
stand the format of exam and to focus on important areas in the subject I saw many students asking their straight
seniors for previous exam models but they couldn't find any papers and I also saw students searching in library
but no result so, I thought to provide all previous exam papers for all students including all branches to help them
preparing for exam with free of cost My app will help those students to gain knowledge and brings awareness of
exam model. This in tum leads to more success percentage among students also slowly I want to develop my app
which will be useful for other colleges also
